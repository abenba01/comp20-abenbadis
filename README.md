Lab 9

1. The purpose of the Git repository is to give me access to my work after COMP20 has ended. I can then send my work to other people (i.e., family members I want to show off to and potential employers) to show them what I learned in COMP20 and my capabilities as a web programmer.

2. My favorite lab was the responsive design lab. I enjoyed the logic behind the programming, but what I found most interesting was the concepts behind responsive design. As a human factors engineer, usability is extremely important for good interfaces, and responsive design increases the usability of a website through its properties that accommodate many screens. Therefore, responsive design is essential for high quality user interfaces, which will make them easy to use.

3. I think I have grown an incredible amount since the first day of class. Clearly, my technical skills have improved because I now understand basic web programming, but my conceptual understanding of the web and its elements went from nonexistent to pretty in depth. I now know how the web works, and I apply this fascinating knowledge to my everyday life since I am constantly using the Internet.

4. The most important idea that I learned in this class is security. One key thing I learned about security is to "never ever trust user input." It is so easy to break someone's program by feeding it malicious code, which is horrifying.  Additionally, I learned that most owners/programmers of websites don't learn about their website's vulnerabilities until after it has been hacked. Essentially, hackers are always one step ahead of web developers, which has made me understand the importance of only using safe websites. Ultimately, my knowledge of security has taught me to carefully choose which websites I should use and which websites I should provide information to.

5. I would love to delve deeper into client-side development. I really enjoyed making the interfaces that users interact with, and I would love to learn more about client-side development in the context of human factors engineering.
