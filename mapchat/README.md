Alexandra Benbadis, COMP20 Fall 2015
This is the README for COMP20 Assignment 2: Mapchat

1. All aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented. However, the conditional that I set to prevent my ID from displaying twice might cause my program to run slowly with large amounts of data. For the purpose of this assignment, I chose to disregard this factor.
2. I received help from TA Thomas Colgrove, ARC tutor Nathan Justice, and Ming Chow. I also used code from Ming Chow's webprogramming examples for the Google Maps API.
3. I spent approximately 5 hours total on this assignment.
